        <p>Hi! I’m Mary Liu, a writer and creative who brings brands to life through captivating copy. With a passion for storytelling and a firm belief in the power of language, I’ve worked hard to write copy that is catchy, creative, compelling.</p>

        <p>With a Bachelor's degree in English Literature and many years of experience in the advertising and marketing industry, I understand the weight words can hold and how they can shape perceptions, evoke emotions, and drive action. My writing combines wit, charm, and—when appropriate—a cheeky sense of humor, resulting in copy that not only captures attention but also drives action.</p>

        <p>Throughout my career, I’ve worked with a diverse range of clients, from established companies to small businesses, helping them develop their brand identity and establish a strong brand voice. I’ve collaborated with marketing teams, designers, and strategists—transforming complex ideas into concise, engaging, and impactful messages.</p>

        <p>I have experience crafting copy for various mediums, including website content, social media campaigns, sponsored articles, email newsletters, and more. </p>

        <p>Outside of work, I can be found reading in my book nook, taking my cat on adventures, or indulging in artistic hobbies like scrapbooking and photography.</p>
